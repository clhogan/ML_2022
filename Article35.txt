Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. on Friday weathered their deepest decline in more than six years after
the oil company posted a surprise fourth-quarter earnings miss.
Exxon XOM, +2.16% stock fell more than 5% and closed at its lowest since late December. The
decrease was the stock’s largest since Aug. 8 2011, when shares dropped 6.2%. The shares traded as
low as $83, and spent most of the session as the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. DJIA, +1.37%
Exxon earlier Friday said it earned $8.38 billion, or $1.97 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared
with 41 cents a share in the year-ago period.
Excluding a tax-bill benefit of nearly $6 billion and other items, Exxon said it earned 88 cents a share
on revenue of $66.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.03
on revenue of $71.9 billion.
Going into earnings, Exxon had enjoyed some optimism about the oil markets amid rising crude-oil
prices and excitement about the company’s plan to expand its U.S. operations to the tune of $50
billion over the next five years.
The stumble for Exxon brought down other energy names with it, and the sector led Dow declines.

Exxon is one of the few remaining global “integrated’ oil-and-gas companies, dealing with the crude
from well to pipeline to gas pump.

Exxon said its fourth-quarter “upstream,” or exploration and production, earnings hit $8.4 billion, an
increase of $9 billion over the prior-year quarter, driven “by noncash impacts and higher realizations,”
with the largest being the result of U.S. tax overhaul.
Realizations in that segment increased earnings by $1.2 billion, with crude prices up nearly $11 per
barrel compared with the year-ago quarter, Exxon said. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter
was $7.07 per barrel, excluding the U.S. tax reform impact and other items. Oil production itself fell
3% quarter-on-quarter, Exxon said.
The real problem was closer to the pump, however. Exxon’s downstream operations are the lion’s
share of its sales.
Stronger margins, mainly in the U.S., were offset by increased maintenance activities, and Exxon cited
“lower throughput caused by Hurricane Harvey and higher maintenance activities in the U.S.”
although operations in Europe and Asia picked up some of that slack.
Exxon shares have gained 0.6% in the past 12 months, compared with 22% gains for the S&P 500
index SPX, +2.62% and 30% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The SPDR Energy Select Sector
ETF has gained 0.2% in the same period. XLE, +2.26%
