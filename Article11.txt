Gains from asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 were nearly $600 million, down $800 million from the prior year.
LIFO inventory gains were over $300 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, similar to the 2011 level.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.4 billion, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2011.
Oil-equivalent production decreased 5% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production decreased 2%.
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $14.0 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.8 billion.
Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $5 billion.
Dividends per share of $0.57 increased 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.
ExxonMobil commenced start-up operations at one of the world’s largest ethylene steam crackers, the centerpiece of the company’s multi-billion dollar expansion at its Singapore petrochemical complex. Powered by a new 220-megawatt cogeneration plant, the expansion adds 2.6 million tonnes per year of new finished product capacity.
As announced on January 4, 2013, ExxonMobil will develop the Hebron oil field offshore the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador using a gravity-based structure that will recover more than 700 million barrels of oil, an increase versus earlier estimates. Capital cost for the project, which is expected to begin oil production around the end of 2017, is estimated at $14 billion. The platform is being designed for daily production of 150,000 barrels of oil.
Fourth Quarter 2012 vs. Fourth Quarter 2011

Upstream earnings were $7,762 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down $1,067 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Lower liquids realizations, partially offset by improved natural gas realizations, decreased earnings by $70 million. Production volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $400 million. All other items, including over $500 million of lower gains from asset sales, decreased earnings by a net $600 million.

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 5.2% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production decreased 2.1%.

Liquids production totaled 2,203 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 47 kbd from the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was down 1.4%, as field decline was partially offset by project ramp-up in West Africa and lower downtime.

Fourth quarter natural gas production was 12,541 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down 1,136 mcfd from 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 2.8%, as field decline was partially offset by higher demand and lower downtime.

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,604 million, $420 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6,158 million, down $1,487 million from the prior year.

Downstream earnings were $1,768 million, up $1,343 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger refining-driven margins increased earnings by $1.2 billion, while volume and mix effects contributed an additional $80 million. All other items increased earnings by about $80 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,108 kbd were 385 kbd lower than last year's fourth quarter due mainly to the Japan restructuring and divestments.

Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $697 million, up $667 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $1,071 million were $676 million higher than last year.

Chemical earnings of $958 million were $415 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. Higher margins, mainly commodities, increased earnings by $330 million. All other items increased earnings by $90 million. Fourth quarter prime product sales of 5,901 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 370 kt lower than last year's fourth quarter due mainly to the Japan restructuring.

Corporate and financing expenses were $538 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, up $141 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, due mainly to tax impacts.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 59 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.3 billion. These purchases included $5.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
