“First quarter earnings of $9.5 billion were down 11% from the first quarter of 2011.

“Oil-equivalent production was down over 5% from 2011. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 1%.

“The Corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.”

FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

Earnings of $9,450 million, which included gains from asset sales of about $400 million, decreased 11% or $1,200 million from the first quarter of 2011.
Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $2.00, a decrease of 7%.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $8.8 billion, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011.
Oil-equivalent production decreased over 5% from the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 1%.
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $21.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.5 billion.
Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $5 billion.
Dividends per share of $0.47 increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011.
ExxonMobil and Rosneft announced the signing of agreements to progress a long-term Strategic Cooperation Agreement to jointly explore for and develop oil and natural gas in Russia, and to share technology and expertise. Additionally, Rosneft will take equity in exploration and development projects in the United States and Canada.
In Romania, ExxonMobil’s affiliate drilled a successful deepwater new play test on the Neptun block in the Black Sea with the Deepwater Champion drillship and has additional 3D seismic data acquisition planned to support future drilling opportunities on the block.
ExxonMobil participated in a successful exploration well offshore Tanzania which discovered approximately 5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas in a high quality reservoir. A second exploration well is planned to test another prospect on the block.
First Quarter 2012 vs. First Quarter 2011

Upstream earnings were $7,802 million, down $873 million from the first quarter of 2011. Higher liquids and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $980 million. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $850 million. All other items, primarily higher operating expenses and the absence of gains on asset sales, decreased earnings by $1.0 billion.

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased over 5% from the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 1%.

Liquids production totaled 2,214 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 185 kbd from the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was down less than 1%, as field decline was mostly offset by ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects, and lower downtime.

First quarter natural gas production was 14,036 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down 489 mcfd from 2011, mainly due to field decline and divestments.

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,010 million, $269 million lower than the first quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $6,792 million, down $604 million from the prior year.

Downstream earnings of $1,586 million were up $487 million from the first quarter of 2011. Lower margins decreased earnings $40 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $210 million, while all other items, mainly gains on asset sales, increased earnings by $320 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,316 kbd were 49 kbd higher than last year's first quarter.

Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $603 million, down $91 million from the first quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $983 million were $578 million higher than last year.

Chemical earnings of $701 million were $815 million lower than the first quarter of 2011. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $520 million. Other items, including higher planned maintenance and the absence of favorable tax items, decreased earnings by $300 million. First quarter prime product sales of 6,337 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 15 kt higher than last year's first quarter.

Corporate and financing expenses were $639 million, consistent with the prior year.

During the first quarter of 2012, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 66 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $5.7 billion. These purchases included $5 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to acquire shares in conjunction with the company's benefit plans and programs. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $5 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

Estimates of key financial and operating data follow.

ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on April 26, 2012. To listen to the event live or in archive, go to our website at exxonmobil.com.

Cautionary statement

Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2011 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as “proved reserves” under SEC definitions.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items. Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across periods. Reconciliation to net income attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II. The release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales. Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II. Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the “investors” section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
