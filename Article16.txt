EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:

“ExxonMobil’s third quarter results reflect our continued progress across a diverse set of profitable growth opportunities, which positions us well to deliver shareholder value. We maintain a long-term perspective on our business with a relentless focus on operational excellence and disciplined investing.

“Third quarter earnings were $7.9 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2012. Production of oil and natural gas increased from a year earlier as new projects were brought on line and maintenance-related downtime decreased. Significantly weaker refining margins as a result of increased industry capacity negatively impacted ExxonMobil’s Downstream earnings.

“Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.5 billion in the third quarter and $32.6 billion for the first nine months of 2013, in line with anticipated spending plans.

“The Corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.”

Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $1.79, a decrease of 14% from the third quarter of 2012.
Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.5 billion, up 15% from the third quarter of 2012, in line with anticipated spending plans.

As announced on August 8, 2013, Imperial Oil Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. have acquired ConocoPhillips’ interest in the Clyden oil sands lease, approximately 95 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Clyden lease contains 226,000 gross acres and is a high-quality addition to Imperial’s portfolio of oil sands in-situ opportunities.
Third Quarter 2013 vs. Third Quarter 2012

Upstream earnings were $6,713 million in the third quarter of 2013, up $740 million from the third quarter of 2012. Higher liquids and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $440 million. Production volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items, including favorable tax and foreign exchange impacts, partly offset by higher operating expenses, increased earnings by $280 million.

On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 1.5% from the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production increased 2.7%.

Liquids production totaled 2,199 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 83 kbd from the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 5.3%, as lower downtime and project ramp-up in Canada and Nigeria were partially offset by field decline.

Third quarter natural gas production was 10,914 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down 147 mcfd from 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 0.3%, as field decline was mostly offset by lower downtime and project ramp-up.

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,050 million, $417 million higher than the third quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $5,663 million, up $323 million from the prior year.

Downstream earnings were $592 million, down $2,598 million from the third quarter of 2012. Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million. All other items, including lower gains on asset sales and foreign exchange impacts, decreased earnings by $380 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,031 kbd were 74 kbd lower than last year's third quarter reflecting divestment-related impacts.

Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $315 million, down $1,126 million from the third quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $277 million were $1,472 million lower than last year.

Chemical earnings of $1,025 million were $235 million higher than the third quarter of 2012 due primarily to higher commodity margins. Third quarter prime product sales of 6,245 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 298 kt higher than last year's third quarter.

Corporate and financing expenses were $460 million for the third quarter of 2013, up $77 million from the third quarter of 2012, reflecting unfavorable tax impacts.

During the third quarter of 2013, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 34 million shares of its common stock for the treasury to reduce the number of shares outstanding at a cost of $3.0 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Cautionary statement

Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the “Investors” section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2012 Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.

Frequently used terms

This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in Attachment II. References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as “proved reserves” under SEC definitions. Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available through the “Investors” section of our website at exxonmobil.com.

References to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.

The term “project” as used in this release can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
