Exxon Mobil Corp. disclosed the deepest reserves cut in its modern history as
prolonged routs in oil and natural gas markets erased the value of a $16 billion
oil-sands investment and other North American assets.
The equivalent of about 3.3 billion barrels of untapped crude was removed from
the so-called proved reserves category in Exxon’s books, the Irving, Texas-based
explorer said in a statement. The revisions were triggered when low energy
prices made it mathematically impossible to profitably harvest those fields
within five years. The sprawling, 3.5-billion barrel Kearl oil-sands development
in western Canada accounted for most of the hit.
The 19 percent drop amounts to the largest annual cut since at least the 1999
merger that created the company in its modern form, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That includes 1.5 billion barrels of reserves that were pumped
from wells. The previous record cut was a 3 percent reduction taken during the
height of the global financial crisis in 2008. The reserves are now at their lowest
since 1997.
The shares gained 0.2 percent to $81.08 in after-hours trading as of 5:46 p.m. in
New York on Wednesday, after closing at $80.93.
Exxon, facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe into how it
valued its portfolio amid the worst oil market collapse in a generation, signaled
in October and again last month that the revision was probably coming.
The oil-sand mines in northern Alberta are among the costliest types of
petroleum projects to develop because the raw bitumen extracted from the
region must be processed and converted to a thick, synthetic crude oil. As such,
they have been particularly hard hit by the worst oil slump in a generation.
ConocoPhillips on Tuesday removed the equivalent of 1.15 billion barrels of oilsands crude from its books as part of a 21 percent cut that pushed the Houstonbased company’s reserves to a 15-year low.
Other Fields
For Exxon, the equivalent of 800 million barrels in other North American fields
beyond Kearl were also removed from the proved reserves category. Those
reductions were partially offset by new reserves from acquisitions and
investments in the U.S., Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Norway.
Reserves are a key metric watched by investors because they are an indicator,
along with commodity prices, of future cash flow. When the 2008 reserves cut
was announced in February 2009, Exxon shares lost more than 4 percent in a
single day, wiping out almost $17 billion in market value.
Under SEC rules, proved reserves can only include oil and gas fields that can be
produced economically within the next half decade. Price trends from the
previous 12 months are compared against the estimated cost to harvest crude
and gas in determining which reserves are counted.
The revisions of what qualifies as proved reserves are not expected to affect the
operation of the underlying projects or to alter the company’s outlook for future
production volumes, Exxon said.
